# Crypto-Price-Prediction
AI Model to predict crypto prices using modern machine learning and deep learning methods. 

## How to use?

Clone the repository using `git clone git@github.com:Pirimid/crypto-price-prediction.git`. Then follow below steps: 

1. Open the jypyter server on your computer and nevigate to the clone repository. 

2. Open `Visualizing cryptocurrency data.ipynb` file and run the notebook. It will do some plotting for five different cryptocurrency stated in the file. The plots are related to the prices and the fluctuation in it. 

3. Open `CryptoCurrency data EDA.ipynb` to see analysis of `Bitcoin` data. It is really ineresting to see how the prices got changed over the time. 

4. Open the `Prediction of Close price for crypto using LSTM.ipynb`. In the file we have used `LSTM` model amd trained it to predict the future close price of `Bitcoin`, `Ethereum` and `Ripple`. We have shown some prediction for each of the currency as an example as well. 

5. Open the `Predicting Bitcoin Price using twitter sentiment and numeric data.ipynb` notbook. In this notebook we have merged the numeric price data with sentiment score of tweets for each day. This way we can combine the `news` or `tweet` data to predict the prices. It can be converted real-world trading application with thi approach. 

## Model Used 

 LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) network.
